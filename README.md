# Soapy SDR module for Epiq Solutions Sidekiq


# Building for non-X40 cards:
Use the normal build process for cmake projects:

```
$ mkdir build

$ cd build

$ cmake ../

$ make -j8

$ sudo make install
```


# Building for the X40:
**SoapySDR** must be installed from source if using it with the X40.

## Building SoapySDR
The x40 has two different versions of python, python3.8 is default and python3.9.

So when building the **SoapySDR** repo we need to explicitly call out the paths to the python3.8 libraries.

So we need to run:

```
$ cmake .. -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3.8 -DPython3_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.8 -DPython3_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libpython3.8.so
```

We also need to make sure PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH are set correctly:

```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib/epiq:/usr/lib/epiq:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

```
$ export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages$PYTHONPATH"
```

The **SoapySidekiq** repo also needs to be build differently:

## Building SoapySidekiq
```
$ cmake ../ -DPLATFORM="msiq-x40"
```

For all other cards, the normal cmake is sufficient.
